- Hi, I am Kavin. I am interested in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, computational fluid dynamics, numerical methods, flow transition and turbulence and microfluidics.
- I am also interested in machine learning and its applications to my broad interests above.
- My secondary domain interests are additive manufacturing and control theory/dynamical systems theory.
